# jekyll-gutemberg-html5

This project is a frankenstein of the [HTML5 boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) and Matej Latin's [Gutenberg](https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg) typography kit, adapted for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by [JerTurowetz](https://jerturowetz.gihub.io).

You can find the project repo [here](https://github.com/jerturowetz/jekyll-gutenberg-html5).

The HTML5 boilerplate server config, build, test and deploy tools have been removed and the implemented version of Gutenberg has been zealously shaved down, making it easy to jump right in to, replaced by the original Gutenberg or dumped in lieu of your own preferred styles.

## Features

- `/vscode/settings.json` ready to go
- `.editorconfig` defaults for winners

## Requirements

You'll need ruby, sass, jekyll and a few gems to make your life easy. Assuming you have ruby installed:

  `gem install sass --no-user-install`
  `gem install jekyll bundler jekyll-paginate-v2 jekyll-feed jekyll-gist rouge wdm`

## Getting started

- Download or clone this repo
- if you need deps run `bundle install`
- hack it up!
- Build with `jekyll build` or serve with `jekyll serve --watch`

### Placeholder files you should definitely edit

- `_config.yml`
- `src/favicon.ico`
- `src/icon.png`
- `src/tile-wide.png`
- `src/tile.png`
- `src/index.md`

### Editing the sass

`src/base/_normalize.scss` & `src/base/main.scss` are imports from the html5 boilerplate. The `src/_sass/mixins/` & `src/_sass/typography/` folders are my trimmed version of Matej Latin's [Gutenberg](https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg).

The rest is just basic layout stuff that you can hack up however you want. I usually like to set some variables like colors & type, then set up basic layou in `src/_sass/layout/`, then make a new folder called `src/_sass/theme/` and do whatever.

## To do

- Exclude CSS & JS from jekyll and manage with webpack instead
- compress & resize images with whatever used above
- Add basic htaccess/nginx header rules for simple setups
